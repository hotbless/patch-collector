# console command:
1.  Check django install: python -m django --version

2.  Build start project: django-admin startproject patch_collector D:\Projects\patch-collector

3.  Launch django development server: python manage.py runserver
    -change ip:port: python manage.py runserver <ip>:<port>

# Tips:
Automatic reloading of runserver:
The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed.
You don’t need to restart the server for code changes to take effect.
However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.

4. Create app: python manage.py startapp polls

# Tips:
When to use include():
You should always use include() when you include other URL patterns. admin.site.urls is the only exception to this.

# Tips:
For databases other than SQLite:
    . If you’re using a database besides SQLite, make sure you’ve created a database by this point.
       Do that with “CREATE DATABASE database_name;” within your database’s interactive prompt.

    . Also make sure that the database user provided in mysite/settings.py has “create database” privileges.
       This allows automatic creation of a test database which will be needed in a later tutorial.

    . If you’re using SQLite, you don’t need to create anything beforehand.
       The database file will be created automatically when it is needed.

5. Create data model by modify models.py in app directory.

6. Make migration for model: python manage.py makemigrations
   example:
   Migrations for 'article':
    article\migrations\0001_initial.py
    - Create model Article

7. python manage.py migrate
   Operations to perform:
    Apply all migrations: admin, article, auth, contenttypes, sessions
   Running migrations:
    Applying article.0001_initial... OK

8. install django-rest-framework: pip install djangorestframework
   Add it by modify settings.py file: INSTALLED_APPS = ['rest_framework']

9. create serializers.py and viewsets.py under app directory.

10. create routers.py under site directory(with settings.py).

11. import routers file inside the urls.py which contain all the url routes.
    example:
        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.urls import path, include
        from .routers import router
        urlpatterns = [
            path(‘admin/’, admin.site.urls),
            path(‘api/’, include(router.urls))
        ]
