# console command:
1.  Check django install: python -m django --version

2.  Build start project: django-admin startproject patch_collector D:\Projects\patch-collector

3.  Launch django development server: python manage.py runserver
    -change ip:port: python manage.py runserver <ip>:<port>

# Tips:
Automatic reloading of runserver:
The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed.
You don’t need to restart the server for code changes to take effect.
However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.

4. Create app: python manage.py startapp polls
